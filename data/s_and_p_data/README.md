The ^GSPC.csv file is from Yahoo Finance here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^GSPC/history?p=^GSPC)

I thought that the ^spx_d.csv file was from Robert Shiller's yale site here:

http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm

I accessed it around 03-15-2020. But when I went back to get updated data today (04-08-2020) It wasn't there anymore.
