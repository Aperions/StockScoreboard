Hi Nathan,

 It comes about because you’ve deposited enough cash to overcome the losses. TWR removes the effects of cash movements into and out of the portfolio. Your total return number doesn’t.

Point of clarification, TWR doesn’t give you the return of the average dollar. It gives you the return of the portfolio. IRR (internal rate of return) is the measurement of the average dollar. It’s also called cash-weighted return. If you want to calculate that, you could look into the XIRR function in Excel. You only need the dates of the cash flows, the actual cash flows, and the total value (as a negative number, as if you cash out and withdraw) at the end.

Cheers,

Jim

Hi Jim,

Another quick question for you- is it possible for the Time Weighted Return to be negative while the Total Return is positive?

My app is calculating the Time Weighted Return of this portfolio as -17.41% and the (simple) Total Return as 2.18%.

If that is possible, what is the best way to think about what this is telling you? 

--> The Total Return is telling you that you currently have 2.18% more money than you put into the portfolio (in aggregate).

--> The Time Weighted Return is telling you that the average dollar in your portfolio sawa a -17.41% decrease?

So, a positive Total Return gain and a negative Time Weighted Return means that although the investments lost money on average, the portfolio as a whole went up.

Am I understanding this correctly?
